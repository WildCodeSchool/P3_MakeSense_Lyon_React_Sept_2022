## Setup & Use

### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`, `npm run migrate`
- create .env files for the frontend and backend  
 _NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_

### Available Commands

- `setup` : Initialization of frontend and backend, as well as all toolings
- `migrate` : Run the database migration script
- `dev` : Starts both servers (frontend + backend) in one terminal
- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server
- `dev-back` : Starts the Express backend server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools, and refuses unclean code (will be executed on every _commit_)
- `fix` : Fixes linter errors (run it if `lint` growls on your code !)
